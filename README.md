# iPod shuffle Database Builder

This release contains multiple versions of the program:
* Python (RECOMMENDED)
* Win32/C (DEPRECATED)

Please use the Python version, because it is the only one that is actively developed, and it has a lot more features compared to the Win32 version.

To compile the Win32 version, use lcc-win32.

## Usage

To use the Database Builder, copy rebuild_db.py to your iPod's root directory and start it, e.g. with a double click in Explorer or Finder.

Have fun with the program (and with your iPod as well),
